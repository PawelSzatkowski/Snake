Snake game I've made for fun (and learning, of course) halfway through Codementors C#/.NET Junior Developer course. Besides the core of the game, it also has a few implemented features like changeable difficulty and map, or toggleable walls generation. It's not perfectly well-written clean-code-wise, but it works!
